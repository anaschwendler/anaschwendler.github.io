      <description>In the past months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a lot of external API requests. Since I&amp;rsquo;m part of the Marley Spoonâ€™s logistics team, our challenge is to make sure our requests are done in time and everything is delivered in good shape.
Part of this task, as a software developer, is making sure the code I write is well tested, and does what it is supposed to do. Our software has many integrations with our logistics partners.</description>
